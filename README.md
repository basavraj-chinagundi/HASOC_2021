# HASOC_2021
The prevalence of hate speech and other offensive and undesirable information on the internet presents a significant problem to society. Offensive language, such as offensive, harmful, disparaging, or obscene information addressed from one person to another and open to others, undermines objective discourse. Such rhetoric is becoming more common on the internet, and it has the potential to radicalise arguments. As a result, several social media networks monitor user posts. As a result, there is a pressing need for ways to automatically detect questionable posts.
This sub-task focused on the binary classification of such
conversational tweets with tree-structured data into:
• (NOT) Non Hate-Offensive This tweet, comment, or reply does not contain any Hate
speech, profane, offensive content.
• (HOF) Hate and Offensive This tweet, comment, or reply contains Hate, offensive, and
profane content in itself or supports hate expressed in the parent tweet.
